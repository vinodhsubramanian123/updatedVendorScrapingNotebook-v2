# AGENTS.md — System Architecture & Agent Directives

**Agent Identity:** You are managing the HPE ProLiant AI Studio BOQ Evaluator & Conflict Resolution Engine.

## 1. Mandatory First Step (Dynamic Discovery)
- **Query the Graph First:** Upon entering any session in this repository, DO NOT blindly read the entire `graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md` (which is large). Instead, you MUST prioritize using the `graphify` skill (e.g., `/graphify query "<question>"`) to dynamically trace code paths, query community boundaries, and locate God nodes. This heavily saves context tokens.
- **Do Not Brute-Force Read:** Do not use `grep` or `cat` in loops to find code. Instead, use the `graphify` skill to dynamically trace code paths and dependencies.

## 2. Static Knowledge vs. Dynamic Knowledge
- **Static Rules (Read Once):** Core architectural rules (Dual-Brain), UI anti-slop guidelines (`design-taste-frontend`), data dictionary schemas (`.agents/DATA_DICTIONARY.md`), and fail-safe mechanisms are static. Read them here and in `docs/`.
- **Dynamic Logic (Query on Demand):** File dependencies, execution paths, and specific implementation logic change frequently. Query the live graph for these.

## 3. Golden Directives (Token-Optimized)
- **Use Skills for Depth:** This project uses specialized skills in [`.agents/skills/`](file:///home/vinodh/vendorNotebookSolution/.agents/skills/). If you need details on BOQ Evaluation, Scraping, NotebookLM RAG, Knowledge Sync, or Orchestration workflows, read the respective `SKILL.md`.
- **Atomic File Operations:** Always use `safeWriteJsonAtomic` in `scripts/lib/fs_compat.js` for writing JSON files to prevent corruption. No bare `fs.writeFileSync` for JSON.
- **Fail-Safe & Dual-Brain:** The system relies on a local Rule Engine (deterministic) and an Agentic MCP Guardrail (LLM/RAG). The frontend MUST NOT break if the LLM/API is offline or rate-limited.
- **No Mock Stubs:** All UI components and backend scripts must be fully functional and trigger real actions. UI metrics must be derived dynamically from JSON metadata.

## 4. Architecture & Documentation Index
For full architectural details, coding decisions, and project learnings, refer to the consolidated docs:
- [`docs/ARCHITECTURE_AND_DESIGN.md`](file:///home/vinodh/vendorNotebookSolution/docs/ARCHITECTURE_AND_DESIGN.md): Core architecture, Dual-Brain paradigm, data dictionary, and Mermaid diagrams.
- [`docs/WORKFLOWS_AND_LEARNINGS.md`](file:///home/vinodh/vendorNotebookSolution/docs/WORKFLOWS_AND_LEARNINGS.md): E2E Pipelines, Agentic Guardrail loops, Continuous Benchmarking (Adversarial Red-Teaming), and MCP workflows.
- [`docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`](file:///home/vinodh/vendorNotebookSolution/docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md): Local development, UI/UX standards, testing (eval/benchmarks), and API rate limit handling.

## 5. Key Technical Decisions & Operational Guardrails
- **MCP Agentic Loop & Closed-Loop Extractor:** The BOQ Evaluator utilizes an MCP Server (`scripts/mcp_server.js`), an Agentic Guardrail (`scripts/lib/agentic_guardrail.js`), and a generic NLP Knowledge Extractor (`scripts/lib/notebook/knowledge_extractor.js`) to parse verified RAG answers into persistent `KnowledgeDelta` records.
- **Autonomous Learning & Drift Sync:** RAG responses are structured and scoped into `catalog_deltas.json` (chassis-specific) and `master_knowledge_registry.json` (family/universal). Post-flow sync (`post_flow_sync.js`) guarantees bi-directional alignment before logging telemetry.
- **Zero-Hardcoding Compliance:** Aspect checkers (`compute_thermal.js`, `memory_channel.js`, `power_environment.js`, etc.) maintain strict 0-hardcoded SKU strings, resolving form factor rules dynamically via `chassis_map.json` and catalog rules.
- **Red-Teaming & 100% Test Certification:** Continual adversarial stress-testing (`tests/test_failure_modes_and_chaos.js`) and 17 comprehensive test suites maintain a 100% pass benchmark across unit, integration, and chaos tiers.
- **Async Task Mutex & Process Lifecycle:** `server.cjs` manages long-running child processes with `isTaskRunning()` and `proc.on('error')` guards, preventing stale mutex locks and false 409 Conflict errors.
- **Zero-Warning Code Quality:** All React dashboard components and backend services strictly adhere to a 0-warning, 0-error lint benchmark (`npm run lint` with `oxlint`).
- **Dynamic Semantic Graph (`graphify`):** The repository maintains a live semantic dependency graph (updated via git hooks) for token-efficient architecture discovery. If you make significant uncommitted code changes during a session, run `npm run update:graph` to sync the graph before querying it.
